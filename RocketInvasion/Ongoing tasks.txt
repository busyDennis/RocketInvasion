- Research on potential complications with authorship rights when making a hobby game clone.

- Sprite size proportions for various devices.

- First explosion freezes (bug)

- Trajectories for enemy sprites
Steps (borrowed from Galaga):
(1) We choose a group of enemy sprites.
(2) These enemy sprites start the attack: they follow the same trajectory and launch bombs, then disappear below the low border of the screen.
(3) Survivors return to their locations from the top border of the screen.

- Animated sprites, including rocket engine flame for player sprite

- Animated background.
Background examples from games that I know:
(1) like in SM RPG - perpetually moving animated texture
